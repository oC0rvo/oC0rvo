# **👋Hi There**
*I'm Lucas Cabral, a cybersecurity professional passionate about technology and programming. I am currently seeking an opportunity in the field of cybersecurity and Python programming.*
*I'm also interested in collaborating on hackathons, CTFs, and game jams.*

# **💻My story with tech**

*I became interested in the technology field from a very young age. Since then, I've spent years studying and falling more in love with this field every day, but it was in college that I discovered the area that captivated me: cybersecurity.
It was during my cybersecurity course (now my favorite) that I discovered that the technology market was much bigger than just coding and development, a world where the limit was my curiosity. I completely fell in love with this market, and every day I discover something new, which motivates me to keep learning.*</br>

*But of course, the real reason for going to college for technology couldn't be more obvious: Games.</br>*

*Games have always been a part of my life, from tabletop RPGs to spending hours during high school playing League of Legends, Counter-Strike, and of course, Battlefield. I currently maintain an interest in game development as a hobby, along with running RPG sessions and my passion for music (I'm currently a pianist in a band).*

# **💾Tech stack**

*I am currently working on a personal project that involves JavaScript and Python.I'm very excited about how the project is progressing, but it's still in its early stages.*
